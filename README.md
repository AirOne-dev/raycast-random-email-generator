## Build the extension

Open your terminal, navigate to your extension directory and run `npm install && npm run dev`. Open Raycast, and you'll notice your extension at the 
top of the root search. Press `↵` to open it.

## Use the extension

Now, you can press `⌃` `C` in your terminal to stop `npm run dev`. The extension stays in Raycast, and you can find its commands in the root when 
searching for the extension name "Hello World" or the command name "Render Markdown".
